I'm a CSS newbie trying to learn a little for personal fun, but mostly because I need to be able to understand and use CSS as part of my job. I've been in fandom for almost 20 years, so I'm pretty familiar with HTML (how I've managed to avoid learning CSS all this time is a mystery), but this will be my first foray into design with CSS.
